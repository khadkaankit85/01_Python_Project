Exercise: Building a To-Do List Application
Description:
Create a simple to-do list application in Python. This exercise will involve using concepts such as functions, data structures, file handling, and possibly object-oriented programming (OOP).

Requirements:

User Interface:

Implement a command-line interface for the to-do list.
Display a menu with options such as adding a task, viewing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and quitting the application.
Task Management:

Users should be able to add tasks with a description, due date, and priority.
Tasks should have a status (e.g., incomplete or completed).
Storage:

Store the to-do list data persistently, so tasks are not lost when the program exits.
Use a file to store the tasks. You can consider using a simple text file or explore serialization techniques.
Task Sorting:

Implement functionality to sort tasks based on due date or priority.
Allow users to view tasks sorted by different criteria.
Task Filtering:

Provide an option to filter tasks based on status (completed or incomplete).
Allow users to view tasks that match specific criteria.

Error Handling:

Implement error handling to handle invalid user inputs gracefully.
Ensure that the program doesn't crash due to unexpected inputs.
Extra Challenges (Optional):

User Authentication:

If you're comfortable with more advanced concepts, consider adding user authentication. Users should have their own to-do lists.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Explore using a GUI library like Tkinter or PyQt to create a graphical interface for the to-do list.
Tips:

Break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
Plan your program's structure before you start coding.
Use functions to modularize your code.
Test your application with various scenarios to ensure it works as expected.
This exercise will not only reinforce your understanding of Python basics but also introduce you to more advanced concepts. Feel free to customize the requirements based on your comfort level and learning goals. Happy coding!

damn, it looks beyond my python knowledge, but don't worry i will do it, what can be the estimated time for this project?
ChatGPT
The estimated time to complete a project like the To-Do List application can vary depending on several factors, including your current proficiency in Python, the complexity of the features you choose to implement, and your familiarity with the concepts involved. Here are some rough estimates based on different scenarios:

Beginner Level:

If you're relatively new to programming and Python, this project might take a few weeks to a couple of months. Take the time to understand each concept as you go and build the project step by step.
Intermediate Level:

If you have some experience with Python and programming, but you're not yet comfortable with file handling, data structures, and more advanced concepts, the project might take a few weeks.
Advanced Level:

If you're already comfortable with Python and have experience with file handling, data structures, and perhaps even basic OOP, you might be able to complete this project in a week or two.
Tips for Managing Time:

Break down the project into smaller tasks and tackle them one at a time.
Allocate specific time slots for working on the project each day or week.
Use online resources, documentation, and forums to seek help when you encounter challenges.
Test your application incrementally as you add new features to catch and fix issues early.
