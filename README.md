Exercise: Building a To-Do List Application
Description:
Create a simple to-do list application in Python. This exercise will involve using concepts such as functions, data structures, file handling, and possibly object-oriented programming (OOP).

Requirements:

User Interface:

Implement a command-line interface for the to-do list.
Display a menu with options such as adding a task, viewing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and quitting the application.
Task Management:

Users should be able to add tasks with a description, due date, and priority.
Tasks should have a status (e.g., incomplete or completed).
Storage:

Store the to-do list data persistently, so tasks are not lost when the program exits.
Use a file to store the tasks. You can consider using a simple text file or explore serialization techniques.
Task Sorting:

Implement functionality to sort tasks based on due date or priority.
Allow users to view tasks sorted by different criteria.
Task Filtering:

Provide an option to filter tasks based on status (completed or incomplete).
Allow users to view tasks that match specific criteria.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling to handle invalid user inputs gracefully.
Ensure that the program doesn't crash due to unexpected inputs.

Extra Challenges (Optional):

User Authentication:

If you're comfortable with more advanced concepts, consider adding user authentication. Users should have their own to-do lists.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Explore using a GUI library like Tkinter or PyQt to create a graphical interface for the to-do list.
Tips:

Break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
Plan your program's structure before you start coding.
Use functions to modularize your code.
Test your application with various scenarios to ensure it works as expected.
